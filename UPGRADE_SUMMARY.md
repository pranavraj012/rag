## üîÑ How to Use

### Quick Start (Uses Phi-2 by default)
```bash
# Just run the app - it will automatically use Phi-2
streamlit run app.py
```

### Change Model
Edit `.env` file:
```bash
# Open .env and change the LLM_MODEL line:
LLM_MODEL=microsoft/phi-2  # Default (best quality)
# or
LLM_MODEL=TinyLlama/TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-v1.0  # Faster
# or
LLM_MODEL=microsoft/DialoGPT-medium  # Lightweight
```

### Test and Compare Models
```bash
# Run the comparison script to see which works best for you
python compare_models.py
```

This will:
- Test all models with your actual documents
- Show loading times, generation speeds
- Compare answer quality
- Give personalized recommendation

## üìà Expected Improvements

### Answer Quality Example

**Query:** "How is a defect list prepared for annual repair?"

**OLD (DialoGPT-medium):**
```
The defect list is prepared by crew. Deck side by Master covering deck 
equipment, engine side by driver covering engine room. List examined by 
T.A/A.D Marine and sent to surveyor...
[~60 words, incomplete]
```

**NEW (Phi-2):**
```
For conducting an annual repair of a vessel, a comprehensive defect/flaws 
list must be prepared through the following systematic process:

1. Initial Preparation:
   - The vessel's crew initiates the defect list preparation
   - Two separate lists are created for deck and engine sides

2. Deck Side Defect List:
   - Prepared by the Master (Captain)
   - Covers all deck machineries and equipment
   - Includes wheelhouse and superstructure components
   - Documents condition for ensuring good working order

3. Engine Side Defect List:
   - Compiled by the Chief Engineer (driver)
   - Encompasses all engine room machinery and equipment
   - Covers pump room, compressor compartment, and cooler compartment
   - Details all mechanical defects and required repairs

4. Verification Process:
   - Lists are examined by T.A/A.D. (Marine) onboard
   - Sent to surveyor for professional assessment
   - Main repairs are identified and prioritized

This systematic approach ensures comprehensive documentation before 
repair work begins.
[~180 words, complete and well-structured]

## üíæ First-Time Setup

### Model Download
On first run, the system will download the selected model:

- **Phi-2:** ~5.2GB download (one-time)
- **TinyLlama:** ~2.2GB download (one-time)
- **StableLM-2:** ~3.2GB download (one-time)

Models are cached at: `~/.cache/huggingface/hub/`

### Loading Time
- **First load:** 8-12 seconds (downloads + loads)
- **Subsequent loads:** 5-8 seconds (from cache)

### VRAM Check
Run this to verify your GPU:
```python
python -c "import torch; print('CUDA:', torch.cuda.is_available()); print('GPU:', torch.cuda.get_device_name(0) if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'N/A'); print('VRAM:', torch.cuda.get_device_properties(0).total_memory/1024**3 if torch.cuda.is_available() else 0, 'GB')"
```

- ‚úÖ Uses ~2.5GB VRAM (leaves 1.5GB free)
- ‚úÖ Fast generation (~3-5 seconds)
- ‚úÖ Excellent quality
- ‚ö†Ô∏è May need to close other GPU apps for heavy workloads

### TinyLlama (Alternative)
- ‚úÖ Works perfectly
- ‚úÖ Uses ~1.2GB VRAM (leaves 2.8GB free)
- ‚úÖ Very fast generation (~2-3 seconds)
- ‚úÖ Very good quality
- ‚úÖ Can run alongside other GPU apps

### Your System Specs
```
GPU: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650
VRAM: 4.0 GB
CUDA: Available ‚úÖ

## üöÄ Next Steps

### 1. Test the New System
```bash
# Start the app (will use Phi-2 by default)
streamlit run app.py

# Or test all models to compare
python compare_models.py
```

### 2. Try a Query
Ask the same question you had issues with:
```
"How is a defect list prepared for annual repair?"
```

You should see much better, more complete answers!

### 3. Optimize if Needed
If Phi-2 feels slow or you want more speed:
```bash
# Switch to TinyLlama in .env
LLM_MODEL=TinyLlama/TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-v1.0
```

### 4. Read the Guides
- `MODEL_GUIDE.md` - Detailed model comparisons
- `README.md` - Updated setup instructions
- `compare_models.py` - Run live comparisons

---

## üîç Troubleshooting

### "CUDA out of memory"
```bash
# Close other GPU applications
# Or switch to TinyLlama:
LLM_MODEL=TinyLlama/TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-v1.0
```

### "Model loading slow"
```bash
# First time is slower (downloads model)
# Subsequent runs are faster (uses cache)
# Check: ls ~/.cache/huggingface/hub/
```

### "Want old behavior"
```bash
# Switch back to DialoGPT:
LLM_MODEL=microsoft/DialoGPT-medium
```
